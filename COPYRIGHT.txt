# file in the Pixel Pen repository, and especially outline the files
# whose license differs from the MIT license used by Pixel Pen.

# It is written as a machine-readable format following the debian/copyright
# specification. Globbing patterns (e.g. "Files: *") mean that they affect
# all corresponding files (also recursively in subfolders), apart from those
# with a more explicit copyright statement.
